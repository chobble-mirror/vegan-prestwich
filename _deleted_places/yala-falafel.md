[July 2019:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/permalink/881805915530159/) "Just checked out “Yala Falafel” on sunnybank, it’s amazing. Everything is vegan with the exception of coleslaw. You basically get a box or pitta full of loads of different stuff like hummous, tomato salad, beetroot, gherkins, olives, spicy cabbage, all topped with a lid of falafels and a load of sauces. I’m in heaven! Wish I’d taken a photo before I started eating it 😂"
