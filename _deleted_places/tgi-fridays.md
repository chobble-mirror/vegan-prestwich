**[Check out TGI Friday's vegan options here](https://www.tgifridays.co.uk/menu/vegan-choices/)**

[November 2022:](https://anar.chi.st/i/web/post/496455686123430852) "I’m stuck indoors suffering with Covid, and a vegan burger and sides combo from TGI Fridays was exactly the comfort food I needed. There’s nothing groundbreaking here but it’s all solid grub, burger is tasty with decent vegan cheese, fries are great, garlic bread is flavoursome, hot sauce dip has a real kick. A solid 7/10 meal!"
