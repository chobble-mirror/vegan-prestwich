**Honest Burgers do a couple of vegan burgers and deliver to Prestwich**

[August 2020:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/permalink/1169659510078130/) "...I can highly recommend Honest burgers in Manchester (bridge street) we went last night. The bacon plant burger was epic! Itâ€™s a beyond meat burger with not bacon and a smoked vegan Gouda cheese. Seriously the best burger Iâ€™ve ever had. Itâ€™s cost us Â£39 for 4 people to eat out 3 of who had 2 soft drinks each and then my other half had 2 pints (so Â£11 of the total bill was his pints as alcohol isnâ€™t included in the offer) definitely worth a visit ðŸ˜Š"
