April  2021: Cheesefake cakes are now often available at [Village Greens](/place/village-greens)!

[January 2021:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/permalink/1296172334093513/) "I've had a few of these cheesecakes and can highly recommend. They are gorgeous 😍 and a real treat. I've had blueberry, banana, biscoffi and cookie so far.😁😋"

"Highly recommend these cheesefakes. Had biscoff a few times and chocolate too. Fabulous guys to buy from and collection is safe and simple🥰🥰"

“We’re on a mission to create a Cheesefake that’s got that creamy, tangy, authentic taste, and is always 100% plant-based.”

[November 2020:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/permalink/1249670235410390) "Just had my first cheesefake from the cheesefake company. It was by default as a customer couldnt collect. It was amazing. I will be ordering more. Cant recommend highly enough and such lovely people to deal with 💚."

"I agree completely. I am not gonna lie I have never found a good vegan cheesecake before so wasn't too hopefully. But it was incredible. We had the pink wafer one. Even my carnivore boyfriend thought it was delicious and he never likes any vegan food. Everyone needs to order one now from these great guys 👍"
