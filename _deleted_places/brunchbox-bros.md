[December 2020:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/permalink/1260829054294508/) "My vegan sat and pepper chicken with chips from BrunchBox is excellent. I forgot to photograph before tucking in, there was a bit more than this"

"I'd suggest chatting to the chef, he was very open and happy to answer questions. Knowing he was vegan was reassuring because I knew he gets it, which you don't always get with non-vegan places cooking vegan food."

"Went there to pick up a takeaway brunch this morning ðŸ˜‹ it was the best I've had in a really long time! So much flavour!"
