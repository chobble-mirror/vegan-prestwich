I was working all day,so asked my colleague who was nipping over to them to ask for a “vegan sausage thingy”..... this is what I received. A bagel with avo, rocket, vegan sausage. This is what I LOVE about pres. they are so relaxed and will make off the menu of nothing catches your eye. Definitely super vegan friendly 💚"

[September 2018:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/permalink/692804244430328/) "Just tried Pres on Bury New Road for the first time at lunch. Really lovely, well presented plates of food. Good options for vegan and gluten free folks. The one thing I will say is the service was a little slow, although they did come out to apologize and explain that they'd had a planning mishap and had to make something from scratch. I'd still go back if I had a little time to spare one lunch."
