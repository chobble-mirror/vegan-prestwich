Vegan cheese options on the pizza, and vegan sausage and salami! Delivery possible.

[November 2018:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/permalink/734806753563410/) "mozzarella, kings road now do home delivery through Deliveroo - loads of pizza options ALL available with vegan cheese option! just had one and it was super yum, and not stingy on the cheese! 😁🍕🌱"

"We ordered their pizzas the other day - they were great! The cheese was really 'cheesy', not plasticy or jelly-like like a lot of pizzas I've had. And delivery was fast (via Deliveroo) and the sweet chilli fries we got were scrumps too."
