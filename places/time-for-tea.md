[February 2022:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/1584805551896855/) "Popped in Time for Tea today, what a beautiful woman! Got the Vegan broth and homemade dumpling bread thing - WOW!! Just what my body needed - lord knows whatâ€™s  in it but it tasted great! Followed by Homemade scone - do yourself a favour - pop  in for TRUE homemeade food!"

[January 2022:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/1572619226448821/) "Wow what a hidden gem. Delicious vegan broth and vegan ginger scone. Weâ€™ll be back next week for vegan bubble n squeak and applewood cheese on toast"

"Julie makes nearly everything herself, and there are always vegan options available. She also takes on suggestions, and is generally lovely. Quirky place too."

"No silly prices and great home made food, poetry reading every fortnight to, great for a chat and some laughter, Julie is such a nice lady x"
