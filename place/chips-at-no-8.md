[November 2020:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/permalink/1261100370934043) "Just wanted to give a shout out to Chips at No.8. I asked before on FB about what vegan options they do and they promptly let me know they offer a curried pea and potato pie as well as vegan battered sausage and vegan black pudding (the latter two are off menu so you need to ask). The gravy, curry sauce and mushy peas are all vegan too. The chips are fried in vegetable oil on request. A lot of thought goes into the packaging which isn't often the case with takeaways, avoiding plastic and using paper/vegware. Above all though, it's an excellent chippy and really tasty."
