[October 2022:](http://www.instagram.com/p/CkIa5vzNLnK) "Getting oat milk delivered to our doorstep in returnable glass bottles has been such a life upgrade. We ran out the other day (we always forget we need more for hot drinks when the weather turns chilly) and had to make do with supermarket oat milk. We were surprised by the drop in quality! And the price ðŸ«£ Highly recommend oat milk from Danny at Prestwich Milk Deliveries."
