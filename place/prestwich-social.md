[June 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CevtW9RNtNe) "New menu alert! We took my mum out for lunch today [@prestwichsocial](https://www.instagram.com/prestwichsocial) and tried the cauliflower and sweet potato curry, grilled cauliflower steak, hummus, and salt n pepper chips. All vegan and really tasty, especially the hummus which had a real zing to it!"

[May 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CeB27rXtHAP) "They have a handful of tasty vegan options on the menu, including the ever-popular beyond burger and a flavourful house salad with quinoa, avocado, and balsamic dressing. They’re not stingy with the chips or the hummus as well! Which we ❤️ to see."
