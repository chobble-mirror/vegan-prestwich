[February 2023:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CofNdUDtkX7) "Finally braved Karenâ€™s Diner. For those that donâ€™t know: itâ€™s a theme restaurant where the staff are incredibly rude. They DO NOT hold back and definitely had a field day with our take of vegans and veggies, but itâ€™s all in good fun and the vegan burgers are really tasty! No vegan desserts, sadly, but Iâ€™m not about to complain to their faces ðŸ˜„"
