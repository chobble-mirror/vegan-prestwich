[June 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CfHBlCjtugm) "Lovely vegan desserts [@thegoodsinmcr](https://www.instagram.com/thegoodsinmcr) this afternoon! I can never resist a dark choc and sea salt cookie, and the lemon and blueberry cake was gooey delicious üíï"

[April 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CcA_jzQNqgf) "We love love LOVE the vegan breakfast from [@thegoodsinmcr](https://www.instagram.com/thegoodsinmcr). Especially at lunch time with a house chai on the side üòã‚òïÔ∏è"

[January 2022:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/1569527016758042/) "I did have a fantastic vegan breakfast at The Goods Inn last week. Really imaginative food, put together with thought, rather than just the standard replacing individual items with vegan sausages etc. The menu said their sausages are homemade and I'd love to know what is in them. They were gorgeous."

[October 2021:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/1494836300893781/) "There's a new vegan-friendly hipster bar opposite Heaton Park Metrolink stop, 'The Goods In' - popped in there last weekend and had a very delicious vegan 'hoagie' sandwich, fried nibbles, a plant milk chai, and a fancy IPA. Recommended!"

"We love the Goods in! It opened during lock down, and its great! Food offering is awesome, and the vegan cinnamon doughnuts are great too!"
