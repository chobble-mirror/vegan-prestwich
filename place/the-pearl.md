[January 2024:](https://www.instagram.com/p/C2Xg-svNIzG/) "Stunning Sunday lunch @thepearlmcr this afternoon üòç We got in contact before we booked as we‚Äôve been burned before with fine dining places not catering to vegans. The response we got was such a warm welcome. They have a continually evolving menu of seasonal dishes with locally sourced ingredients. Four courses on offer and they say at least one option for each will be able to be made vegan üå± Thanks guys, we‚Äôll definitely be in again!"
