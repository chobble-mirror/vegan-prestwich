[November 2022:](https://anar.chi.st/i/web/post/495395906384376399) "Last night I placed an order from Nadia's Street Food - home-style traditional Pakistani curry, with rice and chapattis - which she delivered this morning and was eaten for lunch and tea and I am well impressed!

Proper hearty and wholesome food, beautifully spiced, even the rice was delicious, using all recyclable packaging, can't fault it at all. All her veggie curries are vegan and they were all lush. We had the chickpeas, dahl, and mixed veg today, and mixed veg curries normally aren't my thing but hers was divine!

Many thanks Nadia, we'll definitely be ordering again soon ‚ù§"
