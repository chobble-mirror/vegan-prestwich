[December 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CmMJ0XoNCrp) "Oh hey! @coffeesackprestwich have a new vegan menu out. What do we think? Theyâ€™ve been consistently offering vegan cake recently as well"

[September 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CiAhPOPNH3i) "Did you know @coffeesackprestwich now do vegan cakes? Usually one or two different options every time we go there these days. As big cake fanatics weâ€™re glad to be able to get a fix at one of our favorite spots!"

[June 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ce3fJ5rtNOb) "Vegan menus have arrived @coffeesackprestwich and theyâ€™re pretty great, in our opinion! Lots of choice, all very clear. Great job, folks!"

[June 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CeeBF8uIMuE) "Swung by @thecoffeesack this afternoon for lunch, just in time to try their new vegan option: smashed chickpea salad! Very tasty. Itâ€™s replacing the falafel wrap on their menu, but fear not! Your can sell get falafel as an extra. Theyâ€™re also having a separate vegan menu printed as we speak, hopefully thatâ€™ll be available next time weâ€™re there. A very considerate step and we love to see it ðŸ’š"

[April 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CbfiGN3ryiH) "Feels like salad season! We had a beautiful, healthy lunch at the Coffee Sack this afternoon in the sunshine. Followed up this bevvy of veg with a delicious chocolate torte, all 100% #vegan. AND the staff were lovely ðŸ’š"
