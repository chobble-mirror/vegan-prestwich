[January 2025:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/630026080708145/) "new vegan menu items at Coffee Sack! We both tried the new spiced dahl, on toast and on a jacket potato. It was well fit! I was saying to my wife, Coffee Sack is one of the only places where I'm never disappointed to see menu changes, cause every new thing they come up with is dee-lish"

"They have also massively upped their game with the cakes they offer now. It use to be a gluten free muffin. This time they had about 5 options. They arenâ€™t labelled as vegan but if you ask they will let you know. We love it here."

[November 2024:](https://www.instagram.com/p/DB3-l0MtFL8) "Weâ€™ve not been over to @coffeesackprestwich for a little bit so were excited to find they have new vegan options! We tried the BBQ pulled jackfruit toast topper and jacket potato filling. Really nice and as usual the salad and vegan coleslaw was fresh and delicious. Great coffee too! It is in the name after all."

[September 2023:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/1999686563742083/) "We had lunch at the Coffee Sack today - their new spiced chickpea salad stuff is lush! They've got a full vegan menu (you gotta ask for it) and the coffee and cakes are always A++ too. Highly recommend checking them out"

[July 2023:](https://dumpoir.com/c/6069534814710169413) "New fave! Cauliflower and vegan halloumi salad from @coffeesackprestwich- you have to ask for vegan halloumi, which comes nicely crisped up. Yum!"

[December 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CmMJ0XoNCrp) "Oh hey! @coffeesackprestwich have a new vegan menu out. What do we think? Theyâ€™ve been consistently offering vegan cake recently as well"

[September 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CiAhPOPNH3i) "Did you know @coffeesackprestwich now do vegan cakes? Usually one or two different options every time we go there these days. As big cake fanatics weâ€™re glad to be able to get a fix at one of our favorite spots!"

[June 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ce3fJ5rtNOb) "Vegan menus have arrived @coffeesackprestwich and theyâ€™re pretty great, in our opinion! Lots of choice, all very clear. Great job, folks!"

[June 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CeeBF8uIMuE) "Swung by @thecoffeesack this afternoon for lunch, just in time to try their new vegan option: smashed chickpea salad! Very tasty. Itâ€™s replacing the falafel wrap on their menu, but fear not! Your can sell get falafel as an extra. Theyâ€™re also having a separate vegan menu printed as we speak, hopefully thatâ€™ll be available next time weâ€™re there. A very considerate step and we love to see it ðŸ’š"

[April 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CbfiGN3ryiH) "Feels like salad season! We had a beautiful, healthy lunch at the Coffee Sack this afternoon in the sunshine. Followed up this bevvy of veg with a delicious chocolate torte, all 100% #vegan. AND the staff were lovely ðŸ’š"
