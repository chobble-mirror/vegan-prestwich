[December 2022:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/1821901864853888/) "I’ve just had this huge slice of vegan chocolate and raspberry cake at Nona’s. I also bought all the cheese for my vegan cheese board for Xmas"

"I have had that cake and it is incredible! I also got the Herby goats 'I am nut ok' for Xmas day ✨ god bless Nonna's!!"

[October 2022](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/1779032682474140) "👋 I just wanted to give a massive shout out to Nonna's Delicatessen for their new vegan cheese range from I AM NUT OK. I’ve tried so many bad vegan cheeses I almost gave up, but so glad I didn’t! I’ve only tried the herby goat’s cheese so far but will definitely be going back and trying all the others ❤️"

[October 2022:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/1774249492952459/) "If you’ve not checked out Nonna’s yet they do delicious vegan cakes. I had the Bakewell tart the other week and it was really good! They also have vegan ice cream and a vegan sharing board, but I haven’t tried those yet ♥️"

It’s opening weekend and the new deli on the block is off to a great start by the looks of things. Pictured is their vegan sharing board including soft and hard cheeses, spicy nduja, delicious pesto, and more, plus their biscoff cheese cake - just one of three vegan cakes on offer! So impressed 🌟 We’ll be back soon."
