[June 2023:](https://dumpoir.com/c/3337506739586182213) "Vegan hot dog with a view at the Same Yet ☀️ This is a special they’ve got on at the moment but they do a tasty Thai vegan burger and hoisin mock duck wrap on their main menu as well."

[September 2022:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/1739491083094967/) "Just had a Guinness and a very tasty vegan 'Thai' burger from the lunch menu at The Same Yet down Simister Lane - they also had a vegan chickpea and cauliflower curry on their specials! And their staff were very friendly, too."
