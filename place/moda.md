[January 2023:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/1846781452365929/) "Just had a very tasty vegan breakfast from Moda with really yummy vegan sausages, hash browns, toast, beans, mushrooms, spicy and zesty guac, nice coffee, good beer, can't fault it!"

[December 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CmY64R9t7Fr) "The seasonâ€™s got me craving Sunday roast so we dropped in to Moda on Sunday to check out their vegan offering. The pictures do not do justice to the scale of the scran. I had to be rolled home. It was everything I needed! Roasties, nut roast with cranberries, green beans, carrots and swede mash, and a crisp stuffing ball. Slathered in gravy. Heaven!"

[June 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CfY5yOTN2dO) "Checking out the new kid in town. Welcome [@moda_kitchenandbar](https://www.instagram.com/moda_kitchenandbar)!

Moda may only have a handful of vegan options but they seem well thought out and tasty. We tried the chickpea sausage and avocado sandwich with vegan â€˜slaw and were impressed! The breakfast looks lovely too. They had oat milk for teas and they Guinness was at just the right temperature, according to the husband ðŸ˜„"
