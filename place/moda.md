[June 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CfY5yOTN2dO) "Checking out the new kid in town. Welcome [@moda_kitchenandbar](https://www.instagram.com/moda_kitchenandbar)!

Moda may only have a handful of vegan options but they seem well thought out and tasty. We tried the chickpea sausage and avocado sandwich with vegan â€˜slaw and were impressed! The breakfast looks lovely too. They had oat milk for teas and they Guinness was at just the right temperature, according to the husband ðŸ˜„"
