[September 2023:](https://dumpoir.com/c/4636779984223473813) "Sunny Sunday visit to Heaton Park meant we got to try the “Kickin Katsu” burger there for the first time. Pity me and my attempts to get a good picture! Burgers are hard. Hit the spot though 🍔"

[February 2023:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CpK7gVDNlPT/) "@heatonparkcafes have upped their vegan offerings again! We tried the scotch egg, the bbq Texas strip sandwich, and the chocolate and coconut tart. All great options and not the only ones available. Well impressed!"

[October 2022:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/1772543673123041) "Heaton Park cafe does vegan ring doughnuts! also, hot dogs, paninis, burgers, chips, coffee.. and all compostable packaging too ❤"

"Been really impressed with how well catered for we are at HP."

"The hotdogs are lovely!!"

[April 2022:](https://www.instagram.com/p/CbknWeuKTNN) "Nothing beats Heaton Park in the sun ☀️ and both big cafés have some great vegan options. There’s a mushroom pizza, a burger, usually some cake. For me it’s the soysage hot dog every time though 🌭"
