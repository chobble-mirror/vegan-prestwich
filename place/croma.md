[May 2022:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/1657609267949816/)"I went to Croma yesterday for the first time in ages after I spotted they've got two vegan pizzas on their menu now. I had the bruschetta starter, and then the Carciolo pizza with artichokes and vegan cheese, and the salted caramel icecream after. Not too shabby at all! And the service was fast and friendly, too."
