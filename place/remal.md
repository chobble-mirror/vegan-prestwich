[July 2020:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/permalink/1155907251453356/) "Went to Remal yesterday in the village. Very limited vegan options but everything is clearly labelled and very tasty ( the falafel isnâ€™t vegan and was my friends). We went super early so it was less busy for us."

"They will make vegan bread if they know someone is vegan. The green beans in tomato sauce is lovely ðŸ‘Œ"
