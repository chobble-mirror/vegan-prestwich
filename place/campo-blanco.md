[December 2022:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/1816682708709137) "Tonight we ate at campo blanco in whitefield. The vegan options were great! We had hummus and flatbread, cauliflower wings (the nicest I’ve ever had!) garlic mushrooms, sticky sprouts and Patata‘s Bravas. Would highly recommend."

"I went here last week and meant to say the same. They had all the drinks marked as vegan etc as well. Very impressed"

"we also went to Campo Blanco tonight! it was divine. agreed that the cauliflower wings are the best ever. the hot chocolate liquor cocktails were also really good, and the booze is all labelled as mentioned! just a perfect meal all round"
