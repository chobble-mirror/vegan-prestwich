[January 2025:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/posts/2372474829796586/) "Pizza was OK but croma better. And barely any vegan choices elsewhere on menu

"It‚Äôs ok, broccoli on a pizza is a bit odd ha! Personally I think the Croma pizzas are better üçï"

"We really enjoyed it, they asked for feedback and we said we were disappointed that no dips were vegan and poor choices for desserts and starters but so is croma in that department."

"I really enjoyed the vegan 'lamb' pizza."

"They have a vegan special on with vegan ‚Äúlamb‚Äù but I prefer to get the marinara (tomato and oregano) and add veggies such as peppers, artichokes etc"

"I loved the broccoli on the pizza! Would have liked more. Wasn't sure about the vegan lamb though. Shame very limited starters and deserts!!"

"I went last night and had the marinara (no cheese) and extra toppings. Got the chilli honey dipping sauce and it was delicious! Really nice inside- we had a great quick dinner with the kids."
