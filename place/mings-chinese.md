[January 2021:](https://www.facebook.com/groups/veganprestwich/permalink/1296386690738744/) "We got a scran from Ming's Chinese, Whitefield last night and it was A++ as others have described - as tasty as Won Sheng and similarly generous portions but with various mock meat options including fakey duck pancakes, and much less plastic packaging. Their salt and pepper chips were really tasty too, although I think Won Sheng's slightly crispier ones juuuust beat them there.

Also, it wasn't immediately obvious that they deliver - they do! And no confusion about what was and wasn't vegan - the person who answered the phone totally got it.

Highly recommended!"

"Just an update Iâ€™ve just had the mock duck and pancakes from Wong Sheng and they was amazing and I had the sweet and sour tofu aswell ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹ðŸ˜‹"

"Mings is brilliant... my wife is vegan and enjoys there food quite regularly . Any queries speak to Sue "

"We have ordered from Mings and it is just as good as Won Sheng (our other favourite!! ðŸ˜ƒ)â€¦ But donâ€™t get the curry. It is rubbish."
